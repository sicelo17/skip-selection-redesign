# Skip Selection Redesign

A modern, enterprise-grade React application for skip selection with proper architecture, error handling, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Code Patterns
- **Custom Hooks**: Separation of logic from components
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **API Layer**: Centralized API management with proper error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Optimized with React Query for server state
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback with Sonner

### Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **React Query** (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Zod** for validation
- **Sonner** for toast notifications
- **Axios** for HTTP requests

## 📁 Component Architecture

### UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)
- Reusable, unstyled base components
- Following shadcn/ui patterns
- Variants using class-variance-authority
- Fully typed with TypeScript

### Feature Components (`src/components/features/`)
- Business logic components
- Skip-specific functionality
- Composed from UI components

### Layout Components (`src/components/layout/`)
- Error boundaries
- App-level layout components

## 🎣 Custom Hooks

### `useSkips`
- Fetches skip data with React Query
- Built-in error handling and retry logic
- Caching and background updates

### `useSkipSelection`
- Manages skip selection state
- Memoized callbacks for performance
- Selection validation

### `useResponsive`
- Responsive breakpoint detection
- Window resize handling
- Mobile-first approach

## 🌐 API Layer

### Service Classes
- `SkipService`: Skip-related API calls
- Centralized error handling
- Request/response interceptors
- Type-safe API responses

### Features
- Automatic retries for failed requests
- Request timeout handling
- Response transformation
- Error normalization

## 🎨 Styling Approach

### Tailwind CSS
- Utility-first CSS framework
- Custom design system with CSS variables
- Responsive design out of the box
- Dark mode support ready

### Component Variants
- CVA (class-variance-authority) for component variants
- Type-safe style compositions
- Consistent design patterns

## 🔧 Error Handling

### Multiple Layers
1. **API Level**: Axios interceptors and service error handling
2. **Hook Level**: React Query error states
3. **Component Level**: Error boundaries
4. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications

### User Experience
- Graceful degradation
- Retry mechanisms
- Clear error messages
- Loading states

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Mobile-First
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized typography scaling
- Adaptive layouts
- Performance optimized

## 🧪 Development Patterns

### Code Organization
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency Injection
- Separation of Concerns
- Composition over Inheritance

### Performance
- Memoized callbacks and values
- Optimized re-renders
- Lazy loading ready
- Bundle optimization

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] React Suspense for data fetching
- [ ] Virtualization for large lists
- [ ] PWA capabilities
- [ ] E2E testing with Playwright
- [ ] Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- React Query for efficient data fetching
- Proper memoization patterns
- Optimized bundle size
- Image optimization ready
- Lazy loading patterns

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a production-grade React application with maintainable, scalable, and performant code.

I included the environment variable `VITE_BASE_URL` in the github repository just for demonstation but i would add it in my .gitignore file for security of our sensitive information
